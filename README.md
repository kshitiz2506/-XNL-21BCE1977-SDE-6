Ultra-Advanced Security Implementation & Penetration Testing
This repository demonstrates a comprehensive security implementation for a web application built with Node.js, React, and MongoDB. The project focuses on implementing multiple layers of security, including JWT authentication, input validation, CSRF protection, and more.

Project Overview
This application showcases best practices for secure web development, including:

JWT token-based authentication with secure cookie storage

Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention with Content Security Policy

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection

SQL injection protection through parameterized queries

Secure database handling with MongoDB Atlas

Two-factor authentication (2FA) implementation

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js with Express

Frontend: React with Chakra UI

Database: MongoDB Atlas

Authentication: JWT and OAuth 2.0

Security Testing: SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite


Security Features
Backend Security
JWT Authentication: Secure REST API endpoints with JWT-based authentication

Input Validation: Server-side validation for all user inputs

XSS Protection: Middleware to sanitize user inputs and escape outputs

CSRF Protection: Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests

Rate Limiting: Prevents brute force attacks

Security Headers: Implementation of security headers like Content-Security-Policy

Frontend Security
Secure Token Storage: JWT tokens stored in HttpOnly cookies

Content Security Policy: Restricts sources of executable scripts

Input Sanitization: Client-side validation and sanitization

Secure Error Handling: Generic error messages that don't expose sensitive information

Penetration Testing
The application includes a comprehensive security testing setup:

Static Code Analysis: Using SonarQube to identify vulnerabilities

Dynamic Testing: OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite for penetration testing

Dependency Scanning: OWASP Dependency-Check for vulnerabilities in third-party packages

Deployment
The application can be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes:

Build Docker images for frontend and backend

Deploy to Kubernetes cluster with proper RBAC

Configure HTTPS and security headers
